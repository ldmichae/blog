## Introduction

I love cycling. That's the most important thing to know before reading any further.

If you know anything about cyclists, you know they're also data nerds.

All cycling is data collection. Any given cyclist (myself included) is a moving collection of hopes and dreams all connected together by a GPS signal and dozens of bluetooth peripherals they look to for validation or shame.

The central nervous system of this subcultural phenomena is the humble cycling computer. The prized possession of the humble mamil. The departure of your run-of-the-mill mamil will be heralded by the joyous chirps of a [Wahoo Elemnt](https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-computers) or [Garmin Edge](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/c/sports-fitness/cycling-bike-computers-bike-radar-power-meter-headlights/?series=BRAND482#shopallcycling) device, spurring them on to higher levels of self-exertion and ensuring the collection of data necessary to validate their leisure.

I decided I wanted to try and build one such taskmaster.

And I've decided it is a miracle computers work at all.

## Why?

You, reader, might be wondering; *Why bother? Why spend dozens to hundreds of hours building something inferior to a device you already own?*

This is a great question.

Because this is ***America***, and we're free to waste our time if we good and well choose to.

Well, that and I'm a software developer who's hopelessly curious and sometimes thinks,

> I could do that.

So,  I've decided to try, and I will document my journey along the way. It's joys and disasters, and the many embarassments and triumphs I experience along the way.

I hope you enjoy the journey with me! 😁
